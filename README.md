# steam-friends

Steam Friends is an app to get information on your steam profile and your friends.

## What

* Python server with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
* Code formatting with [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) (pre-commit and GitHub workflow)
* Containerization with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Why

This project is for my own testing purposes - the goal is to create a simple, performant Python server with CI/CD.
